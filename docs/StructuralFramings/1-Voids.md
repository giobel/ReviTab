These commands have been developed for a specific project using these families: [open dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/n5z56p5hnmpxlm0/AADDpVXEmCPbObCBpxR8BUlWa?dl=0). They won't work otherwise. More info [here](https://giobel.notion.site/Beam-Penos-3c0ce8beb0be4e749070a447480e614c)

## Place Void by Face

Add one ore more voids to a beam face providing the distance(s) from the beam start, mid or end point and its size.

## Void By Line

Place a void by face at the intersection between a 2d line (on plan) and a beam. The opening will acquire distance and size from the line style name (*Peno Size - 705x305* or *Peno Size - 0x305* for circular penetration).

## Void By Reference Plane

Place a void by face at the intersection between a reference plane and a beam. The opening will acquire distance and size from the reference plane style name (*Peno Size - 705x305* or *Peno Size - 0x305* for circular penetration).

## Place Tags

Modeless window that calculates the distance from the origin to the beam centerpoint and saves it as Mark. The user can accept or discard the changes.
